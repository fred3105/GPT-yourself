## How to use

- Download your facebook messenger data
- Run parser.py
- Aim to have at least 1M characters minimum
- You might need to run extra data cleaning if your text holds special characters, links or special languages
- Run gpt.py to train your nano GPT model on a cleaned input and wait for it to complete

## Moving to GPT2-small model

- The resulting model from nano GPT is pretty bad, moving to a larger model and fine tuning the LORAS
